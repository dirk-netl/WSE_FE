Recent Achievement
==================

NETL, Cerebras, and the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center recently completed the first ever CFD simulation on a WSE at the
Neocortex facility.  The simulation is of Rayleigh-Benard convection using a new solution method called
`The Accellerated Pseudo Transient Method <https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/15/5757/2022/>`_.  The CFD solver uses the
WFA to compile and run.  Work is currently under way to characterize the exact speed gains and energy consumption relative
to the fastest conventional hardware available.  Our early benchmarks and results are available in an arXiv
`paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13768/>`_. and will be updated as new data comes in.
