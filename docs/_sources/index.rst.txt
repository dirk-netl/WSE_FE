   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to WSE_FE's documentation!

WSE Array Module
================
The WSE_Array class is designed to allow users to work with 3D arrays in a
similar way to NumPy.  In fact, user defined WSE_Arrays are initialized from
3D NumPy arrays through the "initData" keyword on instantiation.  The first two
axes in the NumPy arrays map to tile coordinates and axis 2 maps to the memory
axis on each tile.

Each WSE_Array is designed to represent field data within a cell/voxel in a 3D
structured finite element/volume simulation. Thus, the shape of each WSE_Array
is set to the number of cells in the cardinal axes (including boundary cells).

Each tile holds a column of cells in the third axis of the NumPy data.  Arithmetic
is written from the perspective of a single tile in the array.

Slicing a WSE_Array object is similar to NumPy but is in relative coordinates.
The first axis is usually a slice range which specifies the elements of each
local vector on each tile.  It is equivalent to the slicing in the third axis
of a 3d NumPy array.  The second two axes specify the tile position relative
to the local tile coordinate.  The second axis specifies the relative position
east and west, and the third axis specifies the relative position north and
south.

Arithmetic operations are done in the worker field.  When neighbor operations
are involved, moats send their data into the worker field.  Moats are designed
to hold NSEW boundary conditions and are usually only updated at the tail end
of a time step.  Boundary conditions can be updated through a copy operation
which will move neighboring values from the worker field into the moat.


WSE_Array format:

.. code-block:: python

    dst[1:-1, 0, 0] = s0[2:,0,0] + s1[:-2,0,0]
    dst[1:-1, 0, 0] = s0[1:-1,1,0] + s1[1:-1,0,0]

Numpy format:

.. code-block:: python

    dst[1:-1,1:-1,1:-1] = s0[1:-1,1:-1,2:] + s1[1:-1,1:-1,:-2]
    dst[1:-1,1:-1,1:-1] = s0[1:-1,2:,1:-1] + s1[1:-1,1:-1,1:-1]

Custom IDE With Synax Highlighting
==================================
NETL is maintaining a custom version of the Spyder IDE which supports syntax
highlighing for WSE code.  Installation can be done with conda by following the
instructions below:

1. clone the repository from the `gitlab <https://mfix.netl.doe.gov/gitlab/tjordan/spyder/-/tree/wse_support>`_ repository
2. check out the wse_support branch
3. navigate to the folder with the setup.py and env.yml files
4. run `conda env create -f env.yml --name spyder`
5. run `conda activate spyder`
6. run `python setup.py install`
7. run `spyder`
