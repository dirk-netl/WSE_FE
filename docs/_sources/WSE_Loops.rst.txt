WSE Loops Module
=================
WSE Loops are implemented as context managers.  Portions of the computation graph that exist within
the context manager are tracked so that the RPC seqeunce can be managed to enact a loop.  It is
important to remember that this is not a python loop but a computational graph element that is executed
on the WSE at runtime, not at script execution time.
