WSE Interface Module
====================
The WSE Inference Module is a singleton class which is instantiated in every
other class within the WSE_Package.  It was created this way to provide flexibility
to users and to maintain key program sequences and memory wherever it is used.
The WSE provides several key features to the API:

1) Maintains program sequences
2) Handles memory spaces with no need for user input
3) Handles controller specific operations as well as global operations (Looping, conditionals, global reductions, controller arithmetic)
4) Handles code optimization
5) Enables compiler directives
6) Compiles into WSE images and maps
7) Handles validation in NumPy

Almost all of this functionality is handled automatically and is not a necessary
concern for end users.
