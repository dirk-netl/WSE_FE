Coding Style Guidelines
=======================

Python
------
NETL strictly adheres to the PEP8 coding standard with a modified maximum line length of 120 characters.  Code will not
be accepted unless it meets these standards.  This is not onerous especially since modern IDEs like Spyder have code
style warning/guide systems built in.  It is suggested that users install the custom Spyder version above and make
use of the "Show code style warnings" option in the Source menu.  To adjust the line length go to Tools, preferences,
Completion and linting, Code style and formatting, and then set the "Maximum allowed line length" to 120.

no coding standard has been adopted yet, but will be coming.

Python Docstrings
-----------------
Please follow the Numpy docstring format.  In spyder, a template can be autogenerated using Ctrl+Alt+D right after
the method/class definition.
