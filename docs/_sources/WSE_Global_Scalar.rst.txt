WSE Global Scalar Module
========================
The WSE Global Scalar Module is designed to handle global, mutable scalars in the
WFA.  Global scalars live in the memory space of the controller and
are broadcast with the arguments when an operation is evoked.  This approach
conserves memory on the system and incurs minimal latencies.  It is most
commonly used in calculating dot products in linear solvers.  The Module
supports a limited but growing number of scalar-scalar operations.  These
operations are conducted on the controller tile.
